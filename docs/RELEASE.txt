# New releases

When doing new releases of the extension, check the following:

* Version number
	* Always change the version number when doing a new release of the extension
	* The version number is located in the extension config.xml file, the readme file and the export package
		* The config.xml file is located in "code/community/Nosto/Tagging/etc/" and in it there is a version tag
	    * It is good practice to keep a change log in the readme file for every new release
	    * When exporting the release package for the extension from a Magento installation backend, the version number
	    must be entered exactly as it is in the config.xml file

* Update scripts
	* If the changes to the extension require database changes, structural or content,
	then an update script must be created
	* Magento uses this script to do necessary changes when updating between versions
	* It is good practice to split content and structural changes to different files and folders
	* The content change script should be located in "code/community/Nosto/Tagging/data/tagging_setup/"
		* The name of the script file should follow the standard
		"data-upgrade-[old.version.number ]-[new.version.number].php"
	* The database structure change script should be located in "code/community/Nosto/Tagging/sql/tagging_setup/"
		* The name of the script file should follow the standard
		"upgrade-[old.version.number]-[new.version.number].php"

When these things are done, the new release package can be exported from a Magento installation backend at:
"System -> Magento Connect -> Package Extensions"
